### Logs

This is the folder I dedicated to the Grafana outputs for the metrics written by my ingestors, as mentioned in the report.
I prefer data visualization, as I believe it is a best practice for truly understanding large amounts of
data in a compact and intuitive way.

If you would like to access the raw calculations (e.g., latency times, throughput, average values and percentiles),
please check the /code/db/README.md file for instructions on how to obtain that data yourself.
Otherwise, please enjoy my Grafanas 🙂

## How to read Grafana

On the x-axis you can see time intervals in minutes, on the y-axis you can see throughput values.
